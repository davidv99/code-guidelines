# Introduction {#introduction}

This style guide:

- Provides a set of styles and conventions to follow for each Laravel project you undertake.
- Helps to maintain a level of consistency between projects and reduce cognitive overhead needed when switching between them.
- Serves to make it simpler to onboard new developers into existing projects.
- Is designed to change over time, as new patterns emerge and teams expand, taking into account new perspectives.
- Aims to reflect styles and conventions that apply to current version of Laravel at all times.
- **Is and always will be a Work In Progress** everything can change. Feel free to open an issue and discuss anything.
